  Python provides a wide variety of arithmetic operations for use, including the basics:

  Plus: `+`

  Minus: `-`

  Multiply: `*`

  Divide: `/`


  As well as some more advanced operations:

  Integer Divisor: `//` (how many of one number is in another i.e. 65 // 10 = 6)

  Divisor Remainder: `%`  (the remainder after the `//` operation i.e. 65 % 10 = 5)

  Exponent: `**` (the power function i.e. 3 ** 3 = 27)


  Test out the different ways you can use operations on the provided variables before moving on.
