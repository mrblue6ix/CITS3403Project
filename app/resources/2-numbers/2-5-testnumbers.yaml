  Using your knowledge of operations, data types and functions, write a function to perform the tasks on the given variables below.


  Feel free to check on the past sections if you need a refresher.

  If you accidentally modify the given variables, press the `Reset` button to restore the originals (this will remove all other code though).
question: >
  1. Define a function that takes one input.

  2. Write an if statement that multiplies `inputVar` by variable `float1` if `float1` is greater than 15. Otherwise, subtract 2 from `inputVar` and square `float1`.

  3. For each character in the string `str1`, if the character is equal to "l", multiply `inputVar` by 2.

  4. If `inputVar` is of type `float`, or `bool1` is True, make `inputVar` equal `inputVar` integer divided by 3 (// 3) and set `bool1` to False. Otherwise, set `bool1` to True.

  5. Finally, update the corresponding value of `inputVar` in `inputVarList`. Code to do this is already provided to reduce confusion.


  It may be helpful to perform some of these steps in seperately defined functions. Just remember, variables are defined locally, and won't be updated unless the function returns them too!

  def main(inputVarList):
    float1 = 2.5
    str1 = "Hello world"
    bool1 = True
    for n in range(len(inputVarList)):
      inputVar = inputVarList[n]
      # Perform the described tasks on variable inputVar in the space below.


      inputVarList[n] = inputVar
    return inputVarList
  
  print(main([5, 10, 7, 17]))

answer: "[8, 64, 13, 906.0]"
solution: Congratulations on completing the variables module!
