  1. For each element in the list, add its index number to its value. So for index 0, add 0, for index 1, add 1, and so on.

  2. Create a duplicate list of `list1`, making sure you have copied the list elements and not the list itself.

  3. Reverse the order of the duplicate list, then for each element divide it by its index number.

  4. Add the duplicate list to the original list, `list1`.

  5. Multiply `list1` by five so it repeats five times.

  6. Print a slice of `list1` with lower bound 47 and upper bound 58.
prefill: >
  list1 = [5, 10, 7, 17, 23, 0, 5, 32]

  # Perform the tasks on the provided list.
 
  
answer: "[35, 5, 11, 9, 20, 27, 5, 11, 39, 0, 11]"
solution: Congratulations on completing the lists module!
