  The most important function you need to be able to use is your own!


  The `def` function allows you to utilise all of your previous tools to define your own functions, to be used within your Python file.


  By defining a function to perform a task, you can later call on this function to get a desired output, process data or perform a check.


  If you have an intended end goal, and need to perform a task multiple times, it is useful to define that task in a function.
  

  This reduces visual clutter and improves the readability of your main function, benefiting both you and users of your code.


  If you are planning to use your function throughout your code, you need to include a `return` statement at the desired endpoint of your code, as seen below.


  Have a play with the functions below, and try writing your own defined functions to garner a better understanding of using functions.
question:
prefill: >
  def exampleFunc(inputInt):
    if inputInt <= 0:
      return "Invalid input. Give me a number above 0."
    while inputInt < 50:
      inputInt = helperFunc(inputInt)
    return inputInt
  
  def helperFunc(inputInt):
    inputInt *= 4
    inputInt -= 8
    inputInt **= 2
    inputInt += 2
    inputInt /= 10
    return inputInt
  
  # Experiment by changing the input in the exampleFunc() below, and the operations performed in the functions above.

  print(exampleFunc(10))
