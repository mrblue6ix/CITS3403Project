title: Printing Variables
prompt: >
  Variables are a way we can store a value in memory so we can access it later.
  For example, if we wanted to print a variable we could write:

  `message = "Hello, world!"`
  
  `print(message)`
question: In the `message` variable, try changing "world" to "Python"
prefill: >
  message = "Hello, world!"
answer: Hello, world!
