  There are a wide variety of data types in Python, each having different uses and restrictions placed on them. We'll first cover the types you will most often use.


  Common data types include:

  - `int`: Your basic integer number that cannot store decimals.

  - `float`: The number type used to store numbers with decimals.

  - `str`: The data type used to store a string of character data. Strings can be delimited using single or double quotes.

  - `bool`: The true or false data type. Often used as a switch to control a Python function.


  You can change a variables type by parsing the variable through the type. You do this using functions name after the types, such as int(), float(), str() and so on.


  However, be warned! Incorrectly parsing a variable through these functions will throw an error, stopping your Python code in its tracks!


  Examples of incorrect type casting include:
  
  - `int("12.0")` as the `.` character cannot be parsed

  - `float("abc")` as the string `abc` is not a number


  Try having a play with the different data types before moving on. You can use the `type()` function to check what type a variable is.
