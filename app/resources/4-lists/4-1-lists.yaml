  Lists are used to store multiple items in a *single variable*.

  Lists can be created using square brackets, and are indexed using square
  brackets as well (starting from `0`).

  For example, to get the first fruit from the list above, 
  we can use the code

  `print(mylist[0])`
question: >
  Conver the list below so instead of showing three fruits, 
  it shows three sports:

  1. `soccer`

  2. `basketball`

  3. `tennis`

  `print(` your answer once you have it. 
answer: "['soccer', 'basketball', 'tennis']"

  Great work. Lists are the most common form of storing
  multiple objects in a single variable. Other types of collections
  of data include `sets`, `dictionaries`, and `tuples`.
