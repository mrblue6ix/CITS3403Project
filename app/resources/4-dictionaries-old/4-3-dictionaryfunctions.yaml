  Dictionaries have a variety of functions at their disposal to display the information being stored.


  Dictionaries have multiple iterator functions, including `.keys()`, `.values()` and `.items()`, that return an iterator of keys, values and key/value pairs respectively.


  There are multiple methods to remove a dictionary element. `del dictionary[key]` removes the entry, whilst `dictionary.pop(key)` returns the value of the corresponding key whilst removing the entry.


  We can fully clear a dictionary by reinitialising the `dict` variable to an empty `dict`, or by using the `.clear()` function.


  If we want to change the key in a dictionary, we are better off creating a new key/value pair and deleting the old pair.
