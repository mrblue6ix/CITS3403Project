solution: > 
  Well done, you have learnt how to use `print()` and `len()`,
  two commonly used Python functions when working with strings.

  Below is the model solution:

  ```python

  # Lower bound is inclusive but upper bound is exclusive
  
  for i in range(1, 101):
    # If divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"
    if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
      print("FizzBuzz")
    # If just divisible by 3 print "Fizz"
    elif i % 3 == 0:
      print("Fizz")
    # If just divisible by 5 print "Buzz"
    elif i % 5 == 0:
      print("Buzz")
    # Otherwise just print the number
    else:
      print(i)

  ```
